**MOTIVATION**
</center>

This is a short manual that I wish I had when I was trying to figure out
how to get started, and how to continue. The vocabulary that more
experienced developers use has terminology that is not that helpful to
an uninitiated novice. And there are several types of objects that
reside in various obscure places on your computer, and a collection of
commands to view or operate on these objects. Finally, the commands can
be issued from 4 different places: The UNIX terminal window (*e.g.,* on
Macintosh computers), the R Console window, the R Studio menus, or the R
Studio console. I will focus here on operating and navigating within the
R Console window, which can be considered to be necessary and
sufficient.

**BASIC COMMANDS**
</center>

A *package* is a unified integrated set of functions and objects that
can be installed by users of R. A few of these automatically come along
with the R program, but the others must be *installed* (usually from the
*CRAN repository*, which you can browse through to find the package that
you seek) by issuing

**install.packages("package-name")**

The collection of your installed packages is called a *library*,
residing in *e.g.,*
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/library.
All of your installed packages can be viewed by issuing

**library()**

The output (Figure 1) can be a very long list, if you have been doing
this for a while, and is printed out in a separate window, presumably to
avoid cluttering up the main R Console window.

The installed libraries are not directly available for your use, until
you have *attached* them or (in different words for the same thing)
*loaded* them to your *search* path. Here we encounter the confusing
syntax: you attach a package by issuing

**library(package-name)**

It would make more sense for the command to be something like
*attach(package-name)*, since, as just discussed above, library() has a
completely different meaning, and the opposite command is

**detach(package:package-name)**

which removes the package from the search path.

To make matters even more confusing, the argument to *install.packages()* is the package-name in quotation marks; the argument to *library()* is the package-name without quotation marks; and the argument to *detach()* is the form of the package-name that appears as the output of *search()*, which is like *package:package-name* without quotation marks!

You can confirm that you have successfully loaded or removed the package
by issuing

**search()**

which shows what is attached to your search path (Figure 2).

The functions within the loaded packages are available for you to access
and use in your own R code or program. The names of these functions can
be found by issuing (Figure 3)

**getNamespaceExports("package-name")**

I mentioned above that packages can be installed on your computer by
download from the CRAN repository. If you develop your own package, then
you may want to eventually submit it to CRAN. But before you submit it,
you need to do two things:

First, you need to build a .tar.gz *source package*, which is the format
that is required for uploading to CRAN. That can be accomplished by

**setwd(p) \# p is the pathname to your package**

**devtools::document(roclets = c(\'rd\', \'collate\', \'namespace\',
\'vignette\'))**

**b\<-devtools::build()**

The resulting .tar.gz source package will be located in the same
directory as that containing your package (Figure 4). The returned
parameter *b* is the path name for the .tar.gz source package.

![](Picture4.jpg)

Figure 4. Location of .tar.gz source package

Second, in order to use or test the functions within the source package,
you need to install the source package on your computer from your local directory (in
contrast to installing it from CRAN). That can be accomplished by

**install.packages(b,repos=NULL,type=\'source\')**

where b is the path name for the .tar.gz source package that had been
returned by *b\<-devtools::build()* in the previous example.

The several commands in the sequence to take package folders containing
your raw R program file to a functional package attached to your search
path are not too tedious to execute once or twice. But if you are
developing a set of inter-related packages, and you need to fine tune
them, the process can become quite repetitive, confusing, and tedious.
To facilitate this, within the *NoviceDeveloperResources* package I have
provided the function

**checkBuildInstallSourcePackage(dir,packs)**

where *dir* is a character string containing the path name of the
directory holding the package folders, and *packs* is a character vector
of the names of the packages.

**CONFLICT RESOLUTION**
</center>

When you are developing the functions for your package, you may work
back and forth between the R Console and R Studio. This may not be the
best practice, but it has certain advantages. For instance, if you are
debugging one of your functions, it is rather tedious to edit a change
within R Studio, and then process the entire package just to try out the
effect of the edit. It may be faster to copy the edited version of just
the one function, and paste it into the R Console. After a while, you
can lose track of which variant version is which -- there may be one
version that is in the global environment, and another variant version
that is associated with the package. Unfortunately, the scoping
mechanism may invoke the version that you did not intend, and it can be
confusing as to why your edits did not seem to take effect.

To help resolve this type of conflict, I have provided two functions
*conflictOfInterest()* and *conflictOfInterestRestricted(packs)* in the *NoviceDeveloperResources* package. The second version restricts the output of the first version to those packages specified in *packs*. This makes the output a little more focused for a human reader.

As shown in Figure 5, there is a conflict for my function *mapfile()*.
While fine tuning this function, I inadvertently generated a version
that is in the *cardUtils* package as well as a version that I had
unwisely pasted into the global environment of the R Console.
